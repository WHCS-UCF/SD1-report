\subsection{Safety and Security}
\label{sec:safety-sec}
\todo{0.5 pages}

The safety and security of WHCS is primary constraint of the project. Due to
the integration with home, especially access control systems, WHCS must not
negatively affect home security. Additionally, as WHCS is in control of large
currents involving light control and outlet control, great care must be taken
to design circuits and software to prevent fires and misbehavior. If for
instance, we decided to control a light that exceeded the rating of one of the
control relays, then this could be a fire hazard. Also, in terms of door
control, if the mechanism for controlling the door were to fall in to the hands
of a burglar or fail completely this would present a critical safety and
security issue.

For example, there is a trade-off that needs to be made for controlling a door
with an electronic strike. Electronic strikes come in two main flavors:
normally opened (NO) and normally closed (NC). NO favors security by
\emph{failing-secure}, meaning the lock will not be openable if in the event of
a power loss. NC on the other hand will \emph{fail-safe}, meaning the lock will
be openable without power applied. This consideration should be based around
local fire code and depending on the type of door and handle used. We explain
our decision to go with a NO type electronic strike in
\autoref{sec:electronic-strike}.

In general, some principals for making sure that safety and security problems
are taken in to consideration are

\begin{enumerate} \item Analyze potential problem areas \item Develop solutions
for problem areas \item Anticipate failures and handle them accordingly
\end{enumerate}

Through premptive \emph{analysis}, we may determine problem areas. We will
\emph{develop} solutions for these problems, consisting of a description of the
problem, its potential impact, what area does it impact, and what we plan to do
to address it. Finally, we will \emph{anticipate} failures and build in the
developed solutions directly in to our design. These solutions may be in the
form of warning labels (Ex. NO NOT EXCEED 12V 10A) and software checks.
