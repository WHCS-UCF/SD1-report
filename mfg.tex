\todo{this isn't complete from Joseph}
In WHCS we had to consider two construction methods for our base station and
control module boards; through hole boards, and surface mounted boards. Through
hole board technology is the older of the two technologies and is currently
much less popular than surface mounting. One of the of the advantages of
surface mounting is that it takes up less space allowing more real estate for
parts for a given board. Because surface mounting does not involve drilling it
is simpler and faster to construct. Although there are some advantages in
through hole boards for most applications surface mounted technology wins.
Therefore in our design we will be using surface mounted technology.
